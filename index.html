        <p><b>JAVASCRIPT HOME:</b> JavaScript is said to be a relatively easy language to learn, it is seen as a
            much
            needed fundamental to any web developer, we also noted that several other desktop and server programs
            use
            JavaScript including Node.js, databases like MongoDB and CouchDB E.T.C</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><b>JAVASCRIPT INTRODUCTION:</b> JavaScript as we were introduced can do a whole lot nuber of things such
            as
            the ability to manipulate the HTML and CSS of a specific or multiple elements .One of these ways include
            the
            use of <b>getElementById()</b> this example uses the method to find an HTMl element with <b>Id</b> the
            synthax goes like this <b>docment.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "hello JavaScript"
            </b> several others can be altered like HTMl Attribute values, HTML style(CSS), HTML Element, E.T.C </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><b>JAVASCRIPT WHERE TO:</b> HTMl calls on JavaScript using script tags here a block of JavaScript code
            are
            placed in between the opening and closing script tags. there are various ways by which this scripts can
            be
            applied into the HTML document,they inculde placing the script tags in the head or body tags or both in
            the
            .html. There are also different types of JavaScript scripts, they are the external JavaScript and
            exterenal
            references, </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><b>JAVASCRIPT OUTPUT:</b> The various ways which JavaScript can display data and they all depend of the
            use
            of that specific data: for writing into an HTML document we use <b>innerHTML</b>, for writing into the
            html
            output which should only be uused for testing we can use <b>document.write()</b>, for writing into the
            alert
            box we can use <b>window.alert()</b> though the window keyword is not needed and for writing into the
            browser console which is mainly used for debugging we use <b>console.log()</b></p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><b>JAVASCRIPT STATEMENTS:</b> Statements are listd of intructions given to the computer and varios
            statements
            have varios uses either to be excuted or ignored today we shall see some examples of JavaScript
            statements:
            the first one are the <b> Semicolons;</b> they are to be put at the end of each executable statement,
            <b>white space</b> JavaScript ignores spaces so spaces could be inserted into your lines of code to
            encourage clearity, <b>line length and line breaks </b> simply to encourage readability as programmers
            break
            up codes to mltiple lines, other inculdes code blocks, keywords E.T.C. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><b>JAVASCRIPT SYNTAX:</b> JavaScripts syntax are sets of rules to how JavaScript programs are
            constructed,
            they range from values, literals, strings, operators, variable, expression, keyword, identifers and the
            rules they apply, comment, Camel Case and character set. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><b>JAVASCRIPT COMMENTS:</b> Comments are very useful in JavaScript as they give much needed explanations
            on
            what the code is about they are identified by <b>//</b> for single line comments and <b>/*_____*/</b>
            for
            multiple line comment. Apart from explanations, comments can also be used for preventing execution of a
            specific lines of codes.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><b>JAVASCRIPT VARIABLES:</b> variables are simply containers for storing data. apart from that they can
            be
            used like algebra i.e solve arithmentical equation, variables must be identified with unique names
            called
            identifiers they come with thier own set of rules like using of camel or pascal case, short names E.T.C.
            The
            assignment operator <b>=</b> it used to assign values to variables.

        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><b>JAVASCRIPT OPERATORS:</b> They include the assignment operator, the adding operator, multiplying
            operator,
            increment, expomentiation, string cancats, comparison operators E.T.C.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><b>JAVASCRIPT ARITHMENTIC:</b> Just like the operators JAVASCRIPT can do a wide range of arithmentics and
            also
            their precedence order i.e <b>( )</b> has the highest precedence next to <b>.</b> then <b>[ ]</b> and so
            on.
        </p>
